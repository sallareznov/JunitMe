	 Using Spoon Java library to analyze and trasform source code, Alloy a language and tool for relational models, Alloy Analyzer a solver that takes the constraints of a model and finds structures that satisfy them and CodeModel a Java library for code generators we have succeeded in creating a tool capable of generating Java unit tests a given Java program. This tool can be extended in future to be able to treat a bigger variety of java program. Today's tool has been tested on ***** and it is able to generate Java unite tests that can achieve up to ***** of code coverage.
