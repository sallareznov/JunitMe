	 Using Spoon Java library to analyze and trasform source code, Alloy a language and tool for relational models, Alloy Analyzer a solver that takes the constraints of a model and finds structures that satisfy them and CodeModel a Java library for code generators we have succeeded in creating a tool capable of generating Java unit tests a given Java program. Our tool can verify that there no actual error exists for an application. This tool can be extended in the future to be able to treat a bigger variety of Java programs. Today, our tool has been tested on couple of Java open source project and it is able to generate Java unit tests that can achieve up to 88\% of code coverage.
