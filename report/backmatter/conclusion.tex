	 Using Spoon Java library to analyze and trasform source code, Alloy a language and tool for relational models, Alloy Analyzer a solver that takes the constraints of a model and finds structures that satisfy them and CodeModel a Java library for code generators we have succeeded in extending a tool capable of generating Java unit tests a given Java program. Our tool can verify that there no actual error exists for an application. This tool can be extended in the future to be able to treat a bigger variety of Java programs. Today, our tool is able to generate Java unit tests that can achieve up to 88\% of code coverage for 10000 tests.
