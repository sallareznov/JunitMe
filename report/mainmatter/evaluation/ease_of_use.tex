	JunitMe2.0 is very easy to use. Only three parameters (the last one is optional) are needed for the execution of the program. The command line to execute is the following :\\
$java -jar JunitMe2.0.jar <projectPath> <nbTests> <alloyRunCount>$\\
Therefore, the program will analyse the project located at $projectPath$, execute the resulting Alloy model with a run count fixed to $alloyRunCount$ (if this parameter isn't specified, its default value will be 8), and generate $nbTests$ tests for this project.
