\section{Limitations}
	Despite its efficiency and reliability, our tool has limitations, mainly in the area of types the Alloy model covers.
	
	At the time of writing, JunitMe2.0 cannot instantiate generic, parameterized types and arrays in the tests.
	Interfaces and abstract types also cannot be instanciated in the tests, so the tool just skips them during the construction of the Alloy model.
	
	Fortunately, these functionalities can be implemented easily in the future, the design of the code being generic enough to allow so.
