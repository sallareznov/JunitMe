\section{Performance}
\label{sec:Performance}
	The performance is the main drawback of our tool. On small project (i.e. <= 5000 LOC), JunitMe2.0 behaves pretty well, generating thousands of tests in less than one minute. But it can be very slow on bigger projects, the execution taking several minutes.\\
	This can't be avoided, because many instances are taken in consideration by the Alloy solver.
