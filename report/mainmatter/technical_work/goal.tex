\label{sec:Goal}
The goal of this tool is to generate a large amount of Java unit tests automatically so that we can achieve a good coverage of code with no time or effort spent. Therefore developers can focus on developing the business layer without worrying about testing the code they have written.
Our tool can be used to verify that no bugs will occur when objects of the program interact with each other. In other words, our tool can verify that there no actual error exists for an application.
