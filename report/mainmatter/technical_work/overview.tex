\label{sec:Overview}
The main idea behind our project is to define the structure of a given Java program and to export collection of constraints that describes this structure. After analyzing these constraints, if it is possible, we generate all instances that satisfy the constraints.\\
By translating these instances to Java and then generating Java unit tests, we can obtain a good code coverage automatically.\\
